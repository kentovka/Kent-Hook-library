# Kent-Hook-library
Really fast hook&gamemode library replacement for Garry's Mod.

I tried to make a hook lib as max performant as possible.
It can break your gmod.

Kent-Hook-library is not well tested, but you can be a part of tester team, just submit issues in this repo, if you'll find any bugs
